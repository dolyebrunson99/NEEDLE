We will start by adding a few new ops leveraging our new CPU/CUDA backends. Then, you will implement convolution, and a convolutional neural network to train a classifier on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. Then, you will implement recurrent and long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks, and do word-level prediction language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset. \n",

We also have `out_grad`, which is the same shape as `X @ W`. Now, you have already implemented the backward pass of matrix multiplication in a previous assignment, and we can use this knowledge to get some insight into the backward pass of convolution. In particular, referencing your matmul backward implementation, you may notice (heuristically speaking here):\n",

    "\n",
    "As we saw on the [last few slides here](https://dlsyscourse.org/slides/conv_nets.pdf) in class, the transpose of a convolution can be found by simply flipping the kernel. Since we're working in 2D instead of 1D, this means flipping the kernel both vertically and horizontally (thus why we implemented `flip`).\n",
